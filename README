Name: How to create AWS EC2 Auto-Scaling Group for High Availability using Terraform? 
Description: AWS Infrastructure Buildout with Terraform

/* This Terraform code is the main set of the configuration, we will use Terraform to create an autoscaling group that 
can automatically scale our EC2 instances up or down based on demand. Create a new VPC with a CIDR block and name.
Then create 2 public and 2 private subnets. The IP CIDR information is in the variables.tf file. This makes the file 
reusable. Use the data block in the providers.tf file to pull availability zone information for both sets of subnets.
Terraform's Infrastructure as code (IaC) to automate the creation and management of our AWS resources. This will allow 
us to spend less time managing infrastructure and more time to developing our applications.
